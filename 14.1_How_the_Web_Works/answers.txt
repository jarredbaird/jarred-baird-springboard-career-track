What is HTTP?
    Hypertext transfer protocol. Tells browsers how to get data from or to a server

What is a URL?
    Uniform Resource Locator. An address that indicates a resource on a network.
What is DNS?
    Domain Name System. Converts URLs into IP addresses.
What is a query string?
    Allows you to pass keys and values into the URL.
What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
    GET - get data from server; POST - send data to server
What is an HTTP request?
    A request from browser to server using HTTP
What is an HTTP response?
    A response from server to browser using HTTP
What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
    Contains additional information about a request or response
    Accept, Accept-language
    Content-Type, Cache-Control
What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
    I'm assuming that "Enter" or "Go" is them pressed...
    1. DNS resolves URL to IP address.
    2. Request (URLs in the browser will ALWAYS be GET requests) bounces from router to router until it reaches the intended server.
    3. Server processes and does what you tell it to do
    4. Server sends response back to you.
    5. Browser analyzes body of response and sends additional requests, if needed
    6. Browser takes responses, creates a DOM, and renders the response on your screen. Voila!
